#     scripts/ci-attendi.sh <sha>        # the run of that commit
#     scripts/ci-attendi.sh <run id>     # that run
#
# Exit status:
#   0  the run succeeded
#   1  a check failed (read why with scripts/ci-errori.sh). The script does not
#      wait for the slow jobs (Windows, macOS) once one job has already failed
#   2  the GitHub API did not answer (the last error is printed)
#   3  the run is still going when the time ran out: run the same command again,
#      it resumes where it was
#   4  the run was cancelled: nothing failed, a newer push on the same branch
#      replaced it, so wait for that one
#   5  the time ran out TG_ATTESA_RILANCI times in a row on the same run: do not
#      wait again, report it in the pull request (AGENTS.md, "Quando fermarsi")
#
# TG_ATTESA_MAX     seconds to wait before giving up (default 540: the Bash
#                   tool of an agent stops a foreground command at 600 s)
# TG_ATTESA_PAUSA   seconds between two checks (default 90: every check costs
#                   two requests and the anonymous limit of the GitHub API is 60
#                   an hour; GITHUB_TOKEN raises it)
# TG_ATTESA_RILANCI how many timeouts (exit 3) are allowed on one run (default 3)
#
# Needs jq, and either gh or curl (the repository is public: no token needed).
